            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The INFP (Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling, Perceiving) and ESFJ (Extraverted, Sensing, Feeling, Judging) personality types represent two very different yet complementary approaches to life. INFPs are known for their deep values, empathy, and introspection, while ESFJs thrive on social connections, organization, and practicality. This contrast often leads to a relationship filled with growth and learning as both partners bring unique strengths to the table.</p>
